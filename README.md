# React
React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development.

# Google-docs-clone
Implemented a capstone project using React and Firebase.

Created a web application that allows users to create and edit documents in a similar way to Google docs.

The most amazing feature is that we can edit a document in real-time. This means that if two people are working on the same document, their progress will be reflected in both instances. 

The Firebase database would store the documents and handle the real-time syncing of changes. 

User authentication and authorization: To ensure that only authorized users can access and edit documents, you'll need to implement a system for user authentication and authorization.

In this project built using the following tools

**Front-End**

      React
      
**Back-End**

      Material UI and Quill

**Database**

      Firebase
